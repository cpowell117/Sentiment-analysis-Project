This code is using the Keras library to build and train a LSTM (long short-term memory) model for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset. The code does the following steps:

Imports the necessary libraries, including Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
Loads the IMDB review dataset and limits the number of words to 20,000.
Preprocesses the data by padding the reviews to a fixed length of 80 words, and converting the sentiment labels to categorical variables.
Builds the LSTM model, which consists of an embedding layer, an LSTM layer, and a dense layer with a softmax activation function.
Compiles and trains the model, and saves the training history.
Prints the accuracy of the model on the test set.
Plots the training and validation accuracy and loss over the epochs.
Prints the index of a random good and bad reviews from the test set and decodes them by using the IMDB word index.
